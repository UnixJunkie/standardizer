How to upload a new version of the package so that pip can install it.
Inspired by https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/

# executing setup.py

# note that you might need to bump the version number in there
# so that the tarball can be uploaded

rm -rf dist # cleanup any previous run
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel # update stuffs
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

# upload tarballs to pipy test site

python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine # update stuff
python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

# check package is installable from test site

pip3 uninstall chemo-standardizer # remove previous one
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
  --no-deps chemo-standardizer

# check it is really installed and runnable
which standardiser
standardiser -h

# if tests are OK, upload to production packages site
python3 -m twine upload dist/*

# check install from production packages site

pip3 uninstall chemo-standardiser
pip3 install chemo-standardiser
which standardiser
standardiser -h
