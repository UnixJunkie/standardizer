# standardiser

This is a tool designed to provide a simple way of standardising molecules
as a prelude to e.g. molecular modelling exercises.

To install, download this project and ensure that Python can find
the standardise/ directory.
Note that RDKit must also be installed and accessible to Python.

Or, install via pip:
```
pip install chemo-standardizer
```
